This is an [Astro](https://astro.build/) project which faciliates OAuth flow to use with [Static CMS/Decap CMS](https://staticcms.org).

## Usage

Firstly install packages with `npm install` and then run development server with `npm run dev`.
Then set up GitHub OAuth application, where redirect URL should be `https://example.com/api/auth/done`. Everything else does not matter.
Place the Client ID, Client Secret and Site URL into their corresponding environment variables.

After all of this is done, it can be hosted for example on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) or any other provider, that supports Astro.

## Routes

-   `/api/auth`: faciliates redirect to GitHub's `/login/oauth/authorize` api with the required parameters
-   `/api/auth/done`: uses the `authorization code` to obtain `access_token` and injects the required script with the provided data to authorize Static CMS with GitHub. Also displays if something goes wrong.

## Environment variables

For this application to work, those environment variables have to be set (keep them secret),

-   **OAUTH_CLIENT_ID**: GitHub OAuth application client id
-   **OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET**: GitHub OAuth application client secret
-   **SITE_URL**: Sets the Site URL for production build in the config
